For those who don't know me, My name is Nawwaf Almutairi and I am Computer Science student at Oregon state university. As big as the computer science major is I liked to specialize in building mobile applications for iOS and WatchOS.  

Created this website to share my thoughts and ideas the best way the 21st century can offer which is of course through writing short blogs for all my friends and family who would like to know what I have been up to in my crazy life `^^`

One passion of mine is sharing the knowledge I consume to others by writing tutorials that will make me better at learning materials and hopefully it will help others achieve their goals.

For those interested in my professional career, this is my recent [resume](https://drive.google.com/a/oregonstate.edu/file/d/0Bw0OFPo7hrugZU1rUllMWEF5Tzg/view?usp=sharing)
