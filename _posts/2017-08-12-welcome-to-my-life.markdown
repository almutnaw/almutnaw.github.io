Hello everybody `^^` Welcome to my first blog!! I am super excited to start writing blogs about a lot of interesting topics (at least for me lol) that I witness in my life. This will be my personal space for people to keep up with all the crazy adventures and discoveries that I find while I'm visiting this planet. 


For the last 5 years, I have been studying abroad to obtain a degree in computer science at Oregon state university. I am currently a month away from being completely done with school and moving back to my home country (Saudi Arabia) to be with my family and start looking for a "real job". In these past years, I got to meet a lot of great people who made my experience 1000 times better and taught me a lot of things. I can't deny that it's been a life changing experience for me and hopefully it led me to be a better person. It's definitely gonna be hard to say goodbye but life is a book with many chapters and this next month will conclude this amazing chapter of my life. Thankfully we are in the 21st century which means you could be all around the world at the same time with the internet so it doesn't matter where in the world I will be there is always a way to be connected ❤️
